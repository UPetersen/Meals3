/// Holds the (current, i.e. most recent) meal, using the `dateOfCreation` property.

/// In the meals view, foods can be added only to the topmost (i.e. 'current' or 'most recent' meal).
/// This is being handled by this class. 
///
/// Convention: Each view that has the possiibility to call `GeneralSearch` or `FoodDetail` (both of which can be used to add foods as ingredients to the current meal or reciple) has to set the current meal accordingly. This should be done in `.onAppear()`. Further more, if a meal is deleted or a meal is created, the current meal has to be updated. Generally, if a meal is not selected directle, the current meal is the newest meal available.

    ///
    /// This is faster than fetching the newest meal from the database, but there is a caveat:
    /// If the respective meal is the current meal then the comparison is useless. To avoid this the two meals are compared and if they are equal `updateToNewestMeal(viewContext: NSManagedObjectContext)` is used.
