/// A rotational drag gesture for increasing or decreasing a numerical value, trying to mimic the rotational wheel interface, the first ipods had.
///
/// Attach this gesture to a shape of proper size (e.g. a circle).
///
/// Rotate your finger on the respective shape to increase or decrease a numerical value. Clockwhise rotation increases the value.
///
/// Be aware, that not the angle is used, but the distance the finger is moved. This is independent from the distance of the finger to the center or rotation and provides a more 'natural' feeling.
///
/// Binds to an `NSNumber?. Only positive values will be generated/allowed and instead of zero, nil is returned.
/// Please adapt accordingly if a Double? or anything smilar shall be returned.
///
/// Parameters:
///   - amount: `NSNumber`
